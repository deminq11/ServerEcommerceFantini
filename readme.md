This repository contains my ecommerce project (front and back),
it includes a SwaggerUI endpoint at "URL"/api/docs with every endpoint and how they work,
it has an accounts sistem with email verification and role validation, each user has a cart to add products, and can also adopt pets(WIP for the FrontEnd).


Both dockerfile images for front and back applications are uploaded in dockerhub:

The repository is also deployed in railway:
